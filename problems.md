## Code Implementation (6 points)

Pass test cases by implementing the functions in the `src` directory.

Your grade for this section is defined by the autograder. If it says you got an 80/100,
you get 4.8 points here.

## Free-response Questions (4 points)

Answer the following free-response questions in a separate document,
saved as a .pdf and **uploaded to Canvas**.

#### 1. Use the `generate_regression_data` function you implemented to generate 100 points of data (`amount_of_noise` = 0.1) from a polynomial function of degree 4. Randomly select 10 points as your training data. The rest will be your testing data. Run your implementation of `PolynomialRegression` 10 times, starting with degree 0 and increasing the degree of the polynomial each time, until you reach degree 9. Now create the following graphs.

- A. (0.5 points) A graph that shows the error of your regression on the data as a function of degree. Make the horizontal dimension be the degree of the polynomial used to fit the data. Make the vertical dimension be the error. **Label your axes.** Put two lines on this plot, one that shows TRAINING error as a function of polynomial degree and one that shows TESTING error as a function of polynomial degree. **Make sure to label which is training error and which is testing error.**
  _Hint: Sometimes you don't see the error for some polynomial degree because another one has huge error, making the scale too large to see the error for the other (also bad) polynomial. If you might have this situation, try taking the log of the error before plotting it._
- B. (0.5 points) Create a second plot that shows a scatterplot of your training data. Overlay this scatterplot with plots of the following polynomial curves.
  - The polynomial with the lowest training error (**Be sure to label this curve** with its degree and "lowest training error".)
  - The polynomial with the lowest testing error (**Be sure to label this curve** with its degree and "lowest testing error".)

#### 2. (0.5 points) Given your plots from question 1, describe the relationship between the degree of the polynomial used to fit the data and the training/testing error. At what degree of polynomial do you think you started overfitting the data?

#### 3. (1 point) Repeat everything you did in question 1 with one difference: randomly select 50 points as your training data and use the rest as your testing data.

#### 4. (0.5 points) Compare your results from question 1 and question 3. How did increasing the number of training examples affect things?

#### 5. (1 point) Explain how to do linear classification via Linear Regression. Be clear. Use a graph to illustrate how it works. This graph doesn't need to be generated by your code, but it must be clearly labeled and made by you (not cut and pasted from somewhere). Explain one key weakness of classification via regression. Be clear. Perhaps illustrate this point, as well, with a graph.

_Aside: You can upload the JSON files containing the datasets to http://ml-playground.com/ to see how different learning algorithms work on each dataset. This is not required for points, and you're definitely not allowed to submit scatter plots built by ml-playground, but it might be illuminating and useful for checking your work._
